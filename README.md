First we will be creating a client side database that will enable the user to track different workouts and all the variables assocaited with it.
WHEN the user chooses a workout, It adds the stats to their current graph

THEN they have the ability to add a workout and all the variables associated with it.

THEN the new workout can be chosen by the client. 

AFTER each workout the graph is updated with the stats the client has preformed.
